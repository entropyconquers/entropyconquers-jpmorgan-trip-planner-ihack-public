This repository contains the code for the web application that I built for the JP Morgan iHack 2023 hackathon. The web application is built using ReactJS and the backend is built using NodeJS. The AI model is trained on top of GPT-3 and is hosted on OpenAI's servers. The web application is hosted on Firebase.
